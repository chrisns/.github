# Hi, I'm Chris Nesbitt-Smith 👋

**Skydiving Web Geek** 🪂 | London, UK

I'm a developer at heart with a passion for testing and an active contributor to the open source community. I've been working with Kubernetes since version 0.4 in production environments, particularly in government and critical national infrastructure.

## What I Do

I advise the UK Government on cloud enablement at scale, including leading work on the [National Digital Exchange](https://co-cddo.github.io/ndx/) — a platform designed to break down silos and accelerate technology adoption across the public sector.

Beyond government work, I provide consulting and training to UK & US Government departments, multinational enterprises, and large charities, focusing on:

- **Policy as versioned code** — treating policy like infrastructure
- **Kubernetes security & operations** — container security, admission control, and best practices
- **DevSecOps & supply chain security** — including building the first [Kubernetes cosign admission controller](https://github.com/appvia/cosign-keyless-admission-webhook)
- **Cloud-native architecture** — AWS, Azure, GCP, and everything Kubernetes

I'm also active in the open source home automation space, building privacy-focused solutions that prioritize open standards and user control.

## Speaking & Community

I regularly speak at conferences and meetups on cloud-native technologies, security, and policy management. Recent engagements include:

- **DevSecCon** — Policy as [versioned] code, Kubernetes security patterns
- **Open Source Summit** — Cloud-native governance and compliance
- **Global Government Forum** — National Digital Exchange and modern digital government
- Various meetups and community events

You can find my talks and presentations at [talks.cns.me](https://talks.cns.me).

## Certifications

- **CKA** — Certified Kubernetes Administrator
- **CKS** — Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist

## Beyond Tech

When I'm not working with Kubernetes or writing code, you'll find me in the sky. I've completed over 150 skydives and regularly indoor skydive. 🪂

## Featured Projects

### [cosign-keyless-admission-webhook](https://github.com/appvia/cosign-keyless-admission-webhook)
The first Kubernetes admission webhook using cosign to verify container image signatures. Ensures only cryptographically signed and verified images run in your cluster.

### [k8s-opa-boilerplate](https://github.com/chrisns/k8s-opa-boilerplate)
Boilerplate for managing Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies with kustomize. A practical example of policy as versioned code in action.

### [home-automation-roadmap](https://github.com/chrisns/home-automation-roadmap)
My approach to building a privacy-focused, open-source home automation system. Because open source makes things better, and your home shouldn't phone home to Big Tech.

### [devpsyops](https://devpsyops.com)
Exploring how to apply psychology to development and operations practices — because humans are the most critical component of any system.

### [docker-node-sonos-http-api](https://github.com/chrisns/docker-node-sonos-http-api)
Docker wrapper for controlling Sonos systems via HTTP API. Part of my home automation toolkit.
